/**
 * Dynamic and Static Variables
 *
 * --> Dynamic
 * - In java there's no such keyword, because all the methods and variables dynamic by default
 * - In generally, dynamic refer to things created at the run-time
 *
 * --> Static
 * - Static means “pertaining to the class in general”, not to an individual object
 * - A variable may be declared (outside of a method)  with the static keyword
 * - Static variable shared the all instances available (both read/write)
 * - Static Variable can access using class name ( Ex: ClassName.attributeName static methods are also same)
