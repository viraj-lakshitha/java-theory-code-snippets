/**
 * Inheritance ( Example {@link com.vitiya.java.lecture1.Management})
 * - Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
 * - Uses : Method Overriding and Code Reusability
 * - Class: A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.
 * - Sub Class/Child Class: Subclass is a class which inherits the other class. It is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class.
 * - Super Class/Parent Class: Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits the features. It is also called a base class or a parent class.

/**
 * Polymorphism
 * - Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways. Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms
 * - ** Java doesn't support multiple inheritance
 * - Therefore when implement two or class, here we use "implements" keyword
 * - For Class - "extends"
 * - For Interface - "implements"
